# CSS Variables and JS

Scoped CSS Variables and JS

**What I learned:**

- CSS Variables
- Data attribute and dataset object
- Set properties of CSS variables with JS

Summary:

Learning about variables in CSS is useful information for when redundancy occurs setting the same padding or margin to several elements when you could just use one variable to do all those. I also a learned about scope, because if an element were to have an specific style for say the color than it would stay consistent with the one closest to it rather than a variable defined in a stylesheet.
