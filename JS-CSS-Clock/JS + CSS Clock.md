# JS + CSS Clock

Clock built from JavaScript

**What I learned:**

- DOM manipulation
- JavaScript ```Date()``` instance;
-  Some CSS properties like ```transform``` and  ``` transition```



Summary:

Making the clock was interesting especially the conversion of seconds, minutes, and hours to degrees the hand divs needed to rotate. Small bug I still need to work out is the second hand hitting zero and going once around the whole clock before starting again.
