# JavaScript30
30 Days straight of mini JS projects to get my JavaScript juices flowing more
I never really got to use too much JavaScript during my years in school, so I thought it would be fun to try Wes Bos' JavaScript30 and take the next 30 days to try out his mini projects.
I hope to learn quite a bit about JavaScript, because I enjoy Web Development and will find it useful in my career.
